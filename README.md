# osu!wii
osu!wii is a port of the free-to-play rhythm game, osu! to the Nintendo Wii, powered by [WiiLÃ–VE](https://github.com/HTVo4/wiilove). This attempt to port osu! to the Wii has been inspired by a thread on the osu! forums and [GBAtemp](https://gbatemp.net/threads/osu-wii.251881/) that a osu! port to the Wii is "impossible." This is just a proof-of-concept that it is possible to port osu! to the Wii, and it isn't ready for mainstream use.
